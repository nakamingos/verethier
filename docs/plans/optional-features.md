# Optional feature backlog

Ideas for later consideration. Core work remains in the [implementation plan](halcyon-core-implementation-plan.md).

- [ ] **Funding-chain wallet blocks.** Offer an optional action alongside wallet blocking to review upstream funding addresses and explicitly select additional addresses to block in the same server. Preview the exact addresses before confirmation and reuse the existing block reasons, audit history and role reconciliation. Stop tracing at recognized exchanges or shared services; blocking an exact exchange address does not imply blocking its customers or other recipients. Funding alone is not proof of common ownership. Decide supported networks, data providers, traversal depth and handling of uncertain service labels before implementation. Ordinary Block remains limited to the selected address.
